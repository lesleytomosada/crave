# Crave
 
## Description:
Crave is a web application that helps you satisfy your cravings easily by helping you find the nearest place to get your fix.
 
Crave uses React, Typescript, Express, and Yelp’s API to deliver you quick solutions to your cravings.
 
### How to Use:
Launch the crave app.
Allow it to use your location (essential to find the place closest to you)
Type your craving in the search bar.
Crave will display the closest option it has found, showing you the name, address, distance, and a link to their Yelp page.
If you don’t like that option, you can scroll through the next 4 closest options.
